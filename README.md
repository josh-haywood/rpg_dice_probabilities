This started as a disagreement between friends on what was the best way to determine stats for a pen&paper (D&D) character. Using each technique, the six ability scores are rolled randomly and the some of that array is used to represent the character's overall viability. 

Results show that 4d6, rerolling the first one, then dropping the lowest, provides the most amount of balanced yet viable characters.
